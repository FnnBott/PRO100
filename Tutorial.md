Welcome to the SLAP JACK tutorial!!!

You (Jack) find yourself transported to a strange world filled with every Jack ever.

Slap Jack is a card game where you play as Jack using slap cards to defeat all other Jack Variants. 
Slap cards are powerful but playing them comes at a cost.

Each card has a unique ability that allows you to modify your slaps.
You start 4 cards in your hand, each one can cost from 0 to 4.

You can use cards that increase your damage, heal damage from your opponents attacks, or defend against your opponent.
